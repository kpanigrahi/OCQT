# Oracle Cloud Query Tool (OCQT)
***The fast and secured query tool for Oracle Cloud application.***

OCQT helps you connect to your Oracle Cloud ERP. It can connect to Oracle HCM Cloud, Oracle Finance and Supply Chain cloud database via standard Oracle API from your local machine. I wanted to provide **SQL Developer** like experience for Oracle Cloud. When I started developing and supporting Oracle ERP/HCM Cloud, I found various issues which I think most of the developer/support personel would resonate with:

* All ERP devleopers will be used to tools like **SQL Developer, Toad,** etc. lack the ability for similar environment with Oracle cloud is a major drawback.
* Tools provided within the Oracle BI toolkit needs to go through multiple steps and it is a very time-consumiing process before I can actually see and analyze the data.
* Oracle BI toolkit are restricted with number of results and OTBI limitations.
* There is no direct way to extract all the data directly using Oracle BI toolkit.
* Closing out sessions while downloading a large output file are only adding to the existing issues I have.

If you are facing any of the issue mentioned then **Oracle Cloud Query Tool** is one stop solution.

## Getting started
With very simple steps I can get started with this amazing tool kit. Please follow the below steps:
* Download the latest file for your operating system.
* Create connections
* Start executing the Query

### Isn't it simple?

## Features
* Developers will get the same **SQL Developer** like feel
* **No session timeouts** while fetching data from cloud
* **Faster data download** from cloud
* **No storage of data** in the tool, which leads to real time data access
* Secured by **Oracle Cloud Job/Data Roles**
* Stores all the **history** of the queries executed
* Creates **multiple connections** for same or different PODs
* You can **filter** the results data for more robust analysis
* Export data in **CSV/Excel** format

### future versions
* Export data in **XML** format
* **Intellisense** is available for both table and field level
* **Export/Import queries** from and into the tool
* **Exposes REST APIs** to access data outside this application
* Can **schedule and download** larger reports
* **Save** the existing Queries in the tool

## Benefits
* **Fast** development
* Access to **history** helps to reuse the same query again and again
* User can **query different PODs** like DEV, TEST, PROD, etc. from the same place without leaving the query window
* **Intellisence** makes it easy to write the full Table and Field names
* You can **save the Queries** in the system or outside the system makes it easily available for future use
* **Schedule and Download** larger report option makes it easy to find the latest report
* Data can be downloaded directly in **CSV/Excel/XML** format makes it easy for sharing the same with other team members
* Since I are making use of the **Job/Data Roles** it is very easy for any Security Admin to control/manage different accounts
* Since XML data format is also available, we can also define templates to generate proper reports

## Secured and Reilable
* I never collect/store any information outside your machine. All the connection and other required details are stored in your local machine.
* Leverages the same Job and Data Roles that of Oracle Cloud application.
